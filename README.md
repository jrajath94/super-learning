# 🧠 Super-Learning: Agentic AI YouTube Life OS

Transform YouTube's vast educational content into a structured, high-retention knowledge base. Super-Learning uses a multi-agent orchestrated system to generate, analyze, and coach you through any learning material.

---

## 🚀 Vision
Built for the " Jarvis-like" Life OS experience, Super-Learning doesn't just generate notes; it orchestrates agents to understand, quiz, and mentor you based on first principles and scientific learning methods.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
Powered by a sophisticated **Agent Orchestrator**, the system routes your requests to specialized AI personas:
*   **Learning Agent**: Crafts deep-comprehension notes using pedagogical frameworks (Stanford AI, DSA, Podcasts).
*   **Study Assistant**: Your personal tutor. Ask questions about your notes, request simplifications, or get quizzed.
*   **Learning Coach**: Analyzes your habits and content library to suggest optimization strategies and next topics.

### 2. Specialized Note Modes
*   **🎓 Stanford AI Mode**: High-fidelity analysis focusing on mental models, first principles, and research-grade insights.
*   **💻 DSA & Interview Prep**: Implementation-first approach with pattern recognition, complexity analysis, and coding templates.
*   **🎙️ Podcast & Strategy**: Extracts frameworks, actionable wisdom, and strategic takeaways from long-form conversations.
*   **📋 Quick-Recall Cheat Sheets**: Dense, high-utility summaries for rapid reviews.

### 3. World-Class Infrastructure
*   **Frontend**: Modern Next.js application with a premium "Glassmorphism" UI, smooth animations, and optimized mobile experience.
*   **Backend**: High-performance FastAPI with streaming responses to handle long-form video processing (60min+).
*   **Database**: Robust Supabase integration for persistent storage of notes, analytics, and agent memory.
*   **Testing**: Comprehensive suite with 60+ Playwright E2E tests and Locust load testing for production-grade reliability.
